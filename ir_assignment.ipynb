In the original search system, a basic regular expression analyzer was used to tokenize the words in the documents, by only looking at spaces between text. It is possbile that some potentially relevent documents contain the words in the queries but in different forms, such as surfix ('preparedness' in 16), caplitization ('gold' in 1), tense ('mining' in 1), plurality ('searches' in 9) etc.  Also, removing stop words ('and' in 16 and 19) could help put more emphasis on the more important terms. Take query 28 as an example for checking FN and FP. By searching 'Early Childhood Education', an FP file 'G00-75-2371200' pops up, which is really just a resource book containing all names of different institutions. It showed up in the result only because it the keywords  'early','childhood' or 'education' show up in the document multiple times in the names of different institutions. On the other hand, 'G00-54-2576117' is an FN because it is a relevent file but not extracted out. It's because the key words are not explicitly shown in this document but in their various forms. ] "

      "   elementary school. Over a span of more than thirty years, Head Start\n",
      "   has provided educational, social, medical, dental, nutrition, mental\n",
      "   health services, and parent involvement activities to almost 18 million\n",
      "   children nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Head Start is currently funded at over $6 billion and serves more than\n",
      "   857,000 low-income children and families nationwide. The program is\n",
      "   child-centered, family-focused, comprehensive, and community-based.\n",
      "   Head Start services are designed to address developmental goals for\n",
      "   children, employment and self-sufficiency goals for adults, and support\n",
      "   for parents in their work and child-caring roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Unlike most other federal programs for low-income families, state\n",
      "   governments do not manage Head Start. Rather, Head Start is a direct\n",
      "   federal-to-local program administered by over 1,800 locally based\n",
      "   public or private organizations across the country. At the national\n",

      "   Head Start programs were often not included in policy and\n",
      "   implementation discussions at the state level. This problem led to the\n",
      "   development of Collaboration Grants.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The purpose of the grants is to create a visible presence for Head\n",
      "   Start at the state level, and to assist in the development of\n",
      "   multi-agency and public-private partnerships among Head Start and other\n",
      "   interested stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Why is collaboration between Head Start and state programs important?\n",

      "     * Californias Head Start program is the largest in the nation. In\n",
      "       2002, over 97,000 children will be served by Head Start with a\n",
